@s1 "Good-bye," your mom calls out the open door.  "Don't forget to stay on the path.  The woods are dangerous this time of year." As a cold autumn breeze stings your eyes, you pull the hood on your red cloak up over your head and tie it tightly.  Then you pick up the basket your mother prepared and set off down the path through the woods. Before long you get to a fork in the path.  It's been a while since you visited Grandma, and you don't remember the way from here.  The left path looks well-worn but dark in the shadows of the trees lining it.  The right path is warm and sunny, but there is grass growing across it; this path probably hasn't been traveled in a while.
@p1 You choose the left path.
2
@p2 You choose the right path.

@s2 Although it is shady and cold, you choose the well-worn path on the left.  It should make for speedier travel without all that grass growing on the path. Before long, you hear a rustle up ahead.  You can't make out what is causing the noise, and you're not sure you want to find out.  It sounds big.  You glance nervously behind you.  Is it too late to turn back?
@p1 You run home as fast as you can.
3
@p2 You approach whatever lies ahead.

@s3 Your heart is racing as you run up the steps to your house and burst through the door. "Back already?" Your mother comes into the room.  You explain the whole story to her, and she is not amused. "Really? How can a child at your age scare so easily? Grandma needs that medicine, and I trusted you to take it to her!" You are sent to bed without supper.  You'd better hope Grandma has a miraculous healing tonight. THE END

@s4 The warm, sunny path seems pleasant enough.  The birds are chirping and flowers are still blooming here and there.  You begin to whistle as you imagine giving Grandma a big hug and seeing the smile on her face.  In your head you can picture the two of you sitting together and catching up on all the latest gossip while a warm fire burns in the cozy, little... Wait a minute!  What's this? It seems the path you chose only made a circle.  You are right back at the fork where you started.  It looks like the shadowy path is the only other option.
@p1 You choose the left path.
2
@p2 You decide to go back home

@s5 You're feeling brave and take a few more steps down the path. The rustling stops and a big, hairy creature steps out of the bushes.  It looks right at you and growls.  Then it glances at the basket.  Its expression changes to a toothy grin. "Pardon me, child!  You startled me.  I'm not used to seeing young ones this deep in the woods--not alone, anyway.  Tell me, what's your name, and where are you going with that basket?"
@p1 You tell the truth.
6
@p2 You tell a lie.

@s6 Maybe you were all wrong about this fellow.  He seems nice enough.  You smile politely, tell him your name, and explain that you're going to visit your sick Grandma who lives in a little wooden cabin at the end of the path. "It's nice to meet you, Red.  I'm called The Wolf," he says.  "It's a family name." You tell him it was a pleasure to make his acquaintance, but you really must be going now.  Grandma is waiting. "How sweet!" he exclaims, licking his lips.  "You care so much about her!  You know, I had a grandmother once."  The Wolf blinks a tear from his eye.  "You know what I'll do, Red?  I'll show you a shortcut to your dear Grandma's house.  It's out of my way, but I like you and feel like helping.  What do you say?"
@p1 You turn down his offer.
8
@p2 You take the shortcut

@s7 You make up a quick lie.  The creature seems to believe it.  "And what about you, madam?" you ask politely, eyeing the creature's meaty haunches. "I am called The Wolf," she answers promptly.  "Please don't be frightened though.  I mean you no harm.  In fact, I just had a rather large meal and am on my way home to the cave by the waterfall for a nap.  I'm not even hungry, I swear!" "I am not frightened," you assure her as your stomach let's out a loud growl.  You excuse yourself, wish her well, and continue down the path.  After a few steps, however, you turn and step off the path down a barely visible trail.  You know exactly where her cave is, and you make your way to it as quickly as possible.  There, you hide behind a large tree and wait, the knife from Grandma's basket in your hand. When that wolf shows up, you'll make a nice wolf-pie.  That ought to cheer up Grandma! THE END

@s8 You politely decline and say that you'll stick to the path. The Wolf looks at you sadly.  Tears start to well up in his eyes.  "I know what this is about," he sniffs.  "Nobody trusts The Wolf.  Why, just yesterday I tried to help some little pigs clean off their dusty old houses, and they accused me of trying to blow the houses down and eat them!  I'm not that kind of animal!" Despite your instincts, you feel sorry for The Wolf.  "There, there," you say in your most comforting voice.  You pat The Wolf on the back.  "I'm sure you are not so bad.  And I didn't mean to offend you.  In fact, you're the nicest wolf I've ever met!" "Really?"  The Wolf stops crying and looks at you hopefully.  "That's the kindest thing anyone has ever said to me!"  You invite him to come meet Grandma, and the two of you talk the whole way there and back.  From that day forward you and The Wolf are the best of friends. THE END

@s9 You feel so lucky to have run into such a helpful creature!  You thank him over and over again as you leave the path and take The Wolf's shortcut.  He just grins at you and disappears into the bushes. As you push ahead, the trail becomes narrower and narrower until finally you reach a rock wall and can't go any further.  Hmm, maybe The Wolf was confused when he pointed you this way...or maybe he isn't so friendly after all.  You shiver. It takes you nearly an hour to make your way back to the path, and the woods are getting colder and colder.  What should you do now?
@p1 You run home as fast as you can.

@p2 You continue speedily to Grandma's house.

@s10 The door is slightly ajar when arrive at Grandma's cottage.  You peek inside, but it's too dark to see anything.  "Grandma?" you call.  "It's Red!  I have something for you!  Can I come in?" From the back of the house a gruff, half-muffled voice says, "Come in, dear!  I've been waiting for you." You walk in and head for Grandma's bedroom. And there you see her, safe and sound in her bed. You smile, heading over to hand her the medicines. As she takes, you sit down to share your adventurous little journey to her house. THE END
